# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

This repository contains projects and tasks for learning and practicing C programming with a focus on pointers, arrays, and strings.

## Mandatory Tasks

   - Function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
   
2. **Don't swap horses in crossing a stream**
   - Function that swaps the values of two integers.
   
3. **This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read**
   - Function that returns the length of a string.
   
4. **I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them**
   - Function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
   
5. **I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear**

7. **Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half**
   - Function that prints half of a string.
   
8. **Arrays are not pointers**
   - Function that prints n elements of an array of integers.
   
9. **strcpy**
