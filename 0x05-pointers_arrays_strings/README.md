This is a README.md file for the project# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

This project is about learning the concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming. Below are the tasks included in this project:

1. **Don't swap horses in crossing a stream**
    - Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
    - Prototype: `void swap_int(int *a, int *b);`

...
 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

## Files

- `2-main.c`: Main file to test the _strlen function.
- `main.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.
- `2-strlen.c`: Implementation of the _strlen function that returns the length of a string.

## Requirements

- All files are written in C programming language.
- No use of standard library functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc., except for `_putchar`.
- Betty coding style is followed for all files.
- Each file ends with a new line.

## Task 3: I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them

Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`.

### Prototype
```c
void _puts(char *str);
